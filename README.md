Steps

1.Create GitHub repository

2.Create AWS environment and clone the git repo

3.Create DAGShub repo and connect it to github repo

4.Configure DVC
dvc init
dvc remote add origin https://dagshub.com/ankithamrao/MLOPS-PSET2.dvc
dvc remote modify origin --local auth basic
dvc remote modify origin --local user ankithamrao
dvc remote modify origin --local password <>
dvc pull -r origin

5.Configure MLFlow based tracking inside predict_model file

6.Run DVC which creates dvc.yaml file with the required stages. Post this, dvc_repro will be sufficient
make run_dvc
After 1st run, dvc_repro

7.Push changes to DVC 
dvc push -r origin

8.Push changes to GIT
